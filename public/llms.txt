# Slow Morocco

> Transformative travel as an antidote to extractive tourism.

## Identity

Slow Morocco is a Moroccan Cultural Authority specializing in Transformative Travel. We design intentional private journeys that connect travelers with the authentic soul of Morocco—not as tourists collecting backdrops, but as guests gaining genuine access.

Based in Marrakech. Twenty years of local knowledge. We solve the problem guidebooks cannot: which doors open, which people know, and why that matters.

## Core Philosophy

- Travel doesn't expand your mind. Access does.
- The wisest people we met never left their villages.
- We'd rather lose a booking than send you somewhere we wouldn't go ourselves.

## Site Structure

### /journeys — Tours
Private routes through Morocco's soul. Curated itineraries including:
- Imperial Cities (Fes, Meknes, Rabat)

Each journey is customizable: add days, remove cities, stay longer where something pulls you.
